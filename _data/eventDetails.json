  "eventDescription": "A dance party in collaboration with local DJs and use ticket sales to generate funds.\n\nWith sliding scale ticket options, we believe we can raise money without turning anyone away.\n\nAdditionally, we have the idea to host a raffle at the event to entice party-goers to purchase raffle tickets for fun prizes. One idea is to partner with local businesses to donate prizes and some of us have offered to create some of our own for unique additions."
